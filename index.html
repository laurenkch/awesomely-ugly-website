            <h2>Fun Fact #3</h2>
            <p>You know that statistic about swallowing spiders in your sleep? Someone just made that up. And they made it up just to convince people that anyone will believe anything if you say it's a statistic. But I love the irony that it spread so far. So, from ages 12 - bascially last year I really thought we were out here just swallowing spiders in our sleep without knowing it.</p>
